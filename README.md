# Minnehack 2020

Project Name:
Friendr

Description:
  We created an application that pairs people together based on popular interests.
Users will input what their interests are, and will be paired with people that
have common interests.

  The greater purpose of our application was to bring people together in
the community who otherwise would not be able to interact with each other. Our
easy-to-use app requires little setup so it can be accessible to anyone.

Program requirements:
Java (JDK 10 or greater)
MySQL database (for hosting the Users)
JDBC Driver (MySQL varient, so the app can interact with the database)
